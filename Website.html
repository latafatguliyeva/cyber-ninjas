                <p id="hoc-des">Welcome to the section about our website :)  <br>As you keep exploring the page, you can see that we created the website to introduce you with our team, the events that we organize and projects that we create. And know, let’s talk how the website was developed, which languages did we used in our practice and how we obtained the knowledge of web development.

<br>To obtain the knowledge for developing the website, we passed the courses in Code Academy platform. We passed HTML, CSS and Javascript courses to gain understanding of these languages and develop our website. HTML language is markup language that we have used to create the whole structure of our website, which includes adding title, text, pictures, links and videos. CSS is the language that is used for designing the website. We have used it for making our website more attractive by adding colors, changing the font of the text, bordering the pictures, videos and texts for more good looking view. Lastly, we made our webpage even more engaging by applying Javascript. Javascript is practiced for adding animations to the elements of the website. In this webpage, the text in the table becomes bigger when the cursor is on the text thanks to the usage of Javascript. The percentages of application of the languages that make up our website is the following:  <br><bold>HTML</bold> – 75.1%
<br><b>CSS</b> – 22% <br><>JavaScript</> – 2.9% 

<br>To improve the collaboration among the groups members and avoid conflicting situations, we completed all the tasks mentioned above in one project by using GitHub platform. In this platform, we were able work in one group and upload all the needed files in particular folders. The main advantage of this platform is its saving all the commits and changes that were done by any of the group members, which makes it convenient for usage.
