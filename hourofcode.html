            <p id="hoc-des">Hour of Code, a global event organized by Code.org across more than 180 countries including Azerbaijan, aims to make coding accessible for children. Code.org provides a platform for kids to practice block-based coding, an easily learnable programming type that offers numerous benefits. This approach not only enhances visual representation skills but also fosters critical thinking, contributing to the development of other subjects in school.

<br>The primary goal of the Code.org online platform is to introduce fundamental programming concepts to children while breaking down barriers for those passionate about programming but facing financial constraints or disabilities. By employing entertaining teaching methods, Code.org makes programming enjoyable for students, allowing them to learn through engaging games.

<br>In our role as SITE students at ADA, we organized an Hour of Code event at Baku Technical-Humanitarian Lyceum No.16 on November 3. The event focused on a 7th-grade class, consisting of 20 students, and took place in a computer-equipped classroom. During the session, we engaged the students in a discussion about algorithms, receiving insightful responses about algorithms being sequences of events aimed at achieving specific goals. Students provided real-life examples such as preparing for school or doing homework, demonstrating a solid understanding of algorithms.

<br>Following a brief Q&A session, we guided the students to code.org, where we decided to explore the Classic Maze puzzle. Its entertaining format captivated the students, making the learning experience enjoyable. In their feedback, the students expressed their enthusiasm for the Maze Puzzle, particularly appreciating its game-like format. 

<br>They mentioned that the final tasks posed challenges as they had not used loops before and had a limited understanding of conditional statements. Despite these challenges, the students overall enjoyed the activity, highlighting the success of the Hour of Code event in fostering a positive coding experience. At the end of the event, students got certificates.

<br>In conclusion, heartfelt thanks to Baku Technical-Humanitarian Lyceum No.16 for hosting our event, and to ADA University, Araz Muallim, and Ismayil Muallim for providing a fantastic opportunity to gain experience and mentor children passionate about programming.  See the highlights from our event below!</p>
